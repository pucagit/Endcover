# Endcover ‚Äì Burp Suite Extension for API Endpoint Discovery & Authorization Analysis

**Endcover** is a Burp Suite extension (written in Jython) that assists penetration testers and security researchers in **discovering API endpoints** and **analyzing authentication/authorization controls** with minimal manual effort.  
This extension has proven especially valuable when conducting penetration tests in line with **OWASP WSTG** criteria, streamlining the process of uncovering endpoints and validating access controls.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç API Endpoint Discovery
- **Passive Crawling**: Uses Burp Suite‚Äôs Site Map to identify in-scope API endpoints, taking full advantage of **Burp Professional‚Äôs Crawler** to expand and populate the Site Map automatically.
- **Proxy History Analysis**: Examines Burp‚Äôs proxy history to uncover additional API endpoints, including those that require **conditional requests** or sequence-specific calls before becoming accessible.

### üîê Authentication & Authorization Analysis
- Supports **two sets of credentials**:
  - High-privilege (e.g., admin)
  - Low-privilege (e.g., standard user)
- For each discovered endpoint, sends **three request variants**:
  1. **Unauthenticated**
  2. **Low-privilege**
  3. **High-privilege**
- Determines:
  - **Authentication Required** ‚Äì whether the endpoint rejects unauthenticated requests.
  - **Authorization Enforced** ‚Äì whether access control differs between privilege levels.

### üìÑ Output
- Results displayed in a sortable **Burp tab table** with color-coded auth results.
- Exportable to **CSV** with:
  - Endpoint
  - HTTP Method
  - Parameters
  - Authentication Required (Yes/No)
  - Authorization Enforced (Yes/No)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Options
- Enable/disable crawling
- Enable/disable proxy history analysis
- Set authentication type (Cookie or Authorization header)
- Input high-privilege & low-privilege credentials
- Custom API keyword filtering

## üìä Example Output
| Endpoint         | HTTP Method | Parameters | Authentication Required | Authorization Enforced |
|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| /api/admin/users | GET         | -          | Yes                     | Yes                    |
| /api/public/info | GET         | id         | No                      | No                     |

## üõ† Technical Details
- **Multi-threaded** for faster crawling & history analysis.
- **Variant Request Builder** dynamically modifies authentication headers.
- **Response Analyzer** compares HTTP status codes and body differences to detect access control issues (currently in development ‚Äî planned improvements for more precise and reliable detection).
- **Burp Message Editors** integrated for quick request/response review.
